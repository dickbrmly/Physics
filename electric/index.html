    <p>I believe energy exists on one of three conducting vectors, static, magnetic, or velocity (time).<br /><br />If energy is conducting on a static vector then
     there cannot be a build-up of static potentual, but magnetic and velocity can be charged.<br /><br />If conduction is on the magnetic vector then
     static and velocity can altered while magnetic cannot. Atoms conduct on a magnetic vector.  A single atom can be staticly charged, or accelorated.
      <br /><br />If conduction is on the velocity vector, then magnetic and static can be altered but velocity or time (same thing) cannot.<br /><br />
        Light conducts on a velocity vector allowing for static and magnetic potentuals (electro-magnetic).
