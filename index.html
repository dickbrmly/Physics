            All matter and energy require a shared perspective to quantize
            parameters. Without a common perspective, value or quantity
            becomes abstract and meaningless. A good example would be money.
            Monetary values have only a solid relationship to monetary values.
            One dollar is 100 pennies. or four quarters. The intrinsic value
            fluctuates with supply and demand. A dollar will buy what it will
            buy today, which is different from yesterday, and it will change
            tomorrow. It is very hard to explain what a dollar means. It can 
            literally change in minutes. Hopefully, a meter will stay a meter 
            without deviation.
        </p>
        <p class="centerText">
            What is time?  Time occurs with change.  If there is no change, 
            there is no time.  Time is NOT a dimension because dimension
            cannot exist without the time to have it.  Even one dimension
            requires time to traverse. The complex concept would be in
            understanding the relationship between velocity and time. Time
            must giveway to velocity. it must dialate or slow down. 
        </p>
        <p class="centerText" style="color:palevioletred">
            [Danger: my unsupported theory] What about velocity?  Does velocity
            have to giveway to time?  Logically, the reverse would have to be 
            true. Altering time would be a,'source of cause' for velocity. What if 
            time is a vector incompassing all directions, and something could starve 
            one of those directions?  Is there enough energy in matter to overcome the 
            deficit? ---clearly.  I do not believe gravity is a force.  I believe matter 
            requires time and velocity occurs in matter to overcome the time deficit. Light 
            cannot escape a black hole but gravity can and light slows down when moving 
            through matter. More? If you were to start falling into a black hole with 
            your eyes closed, you would never know it. You wouldn't feel any force 
            from the falling. You can't feel falling. You can feel weight when on a 
            planet. Force is being applied just as if you where being acceloriated away 
            from the planet. There are experiments and observations that could give insight 
            into this theory.
